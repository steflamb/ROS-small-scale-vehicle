## Repository Structure

- **`./mixed_reality/`**  
  A ROS package that implements the testbed for Simulation-in-the-Loop (SiL), Vehicle-in-the-Loop (ViL), Mixed-Reality (MR), and Real-World (RW) autonomous driving experiments.

- **`./ASE_2025_appendix.pdf`**  
  Supplementary material including detailed figures, tables, and experimental data that were omitted from the main paper for brevity.

- **`./RQgeneration/`**  
  Python scripts and tools used to process `.bag` files and generate data used to answer the research questions in the study.

## Usage

Refer to the `README.md` files inside each subfolder for setup instructions, usage examples, and experiment details.
