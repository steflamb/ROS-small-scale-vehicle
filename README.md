# Replication of A Multi-Modality Evaluation of the Reality Gap in Autonomous Driving Systems

This repository contains the replication package of "A Multi-Modality
Evaluation of the Reality Gap in Autonomous Driving Systems"

In the main directory the following can be found:
./mixed_reality : the ROS package created to perform SiL, ViL, MR, and RW testing.
./ASE_2025_appendix : the additional details, figures, and tables which resulted from our empirical evaluation which were omitted for the sake of brevity from the submitted work.
./RQgeneration : the scripts used to process raw .bag recordings used to answer the work's RQs.
